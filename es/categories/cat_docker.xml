I've used the base version, the slim and the alpine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Initially I moved from the base python3.6 to the python3.6-slim and everything
went great. The main win was that no change was required in the Dockerfile,
it was smaller and more secure (less dependencies, more security, right?)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a while, I decided to move from slim to alpine, because of the size benefit.
While doing the migration I found these drawbacks:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Renaming dependencies&lt;/strong&gt;. I had to convert from &lt;code&gt;apt&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;apk&lt;/code&gt; for every dependency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Working with edge&lt;/strong&gt;. There's always a problem with the edge repository.
Sometimes it's down. Sometimes the packages are broken.
You have to dig a lot in order to have a proper configuration.
Like using &lt;code&gt;--no-cache&lt;/code&gt; flag in apk. Or setting up the edge repo, then having to upgrade &lt;code&gt;apk-tools&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This kind of problems break our pipeline when there's no new commit. And I don't want this.
That's why I've decided to move back to &lt;code&gt;slim&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don't get me wrong, alpine is great, small and secure, and if you don't have many edge dependencies,
I guess it'll work flawlessly, and I would totally use it.
But our image unfortunately has dependencies like postgis, and proj4, which fail a lot in alpine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But my story is not over with alpine, I'll try it again in the future.
I know with time it will get better and better, and I'll understand it more and more.&lt;/p&gt;</description><guid>https://woile.dev/es/posts/moving-from-docker-alpine-to-slim/</guid><pubDate>Sun, 13 Jan 2019 15:34:43 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
